## Contents

This folder includes four main files:

1. **`multivariate_probit_model.stan`**  
   Contains the Bayesian multivariate probit model.

2. **`run_antibiotic_model.R`**  
   Provides a function to run the Bayesian model with customizable parameters:
   - **Sample**: specify the dataset or subgroup to analyze  
   - **Antibiotics**: select the antibiotics to include  
   - **Reference**: define the reference antibiotic for non-inferiority analysis

3. **`compute_noninfer_probabilities.R`**  
   Provides a function that is embedded into 'run_antibiotic_model.R' to:
   - Calculate the probability of non-inferiority for an antibiotic compared to a reference antibiotic across the overall population
   - **Reference**: define the reference antibiotic for non-inferiority analysis
   - **delta**: define the reference delta parameter (non-ingeriority margin, here it is 20 percentage points) for a determined antibiotic compared to reference antibiotic

4. **`compute_profilewise_noninfer_probabilities.R`**  
   Provides a function that is embedded into 'run_antibiotic_model.R' to:
   - Calculate the probability of non-inferiority for an antibiotic compared to a reference antibiotic, stratified by selected covariates from the model
   - **Reference**: define the reference antibiotic for non-inferiority analysis
   - **delta**: define the reference delta parameter (non-ingeriority margin, here it is 20 percentage points) for a determined antibiotic compared to reference antibiotic
